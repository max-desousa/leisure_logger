Hey everyone,

So, to understand the purpose of this project it's necessary to understand that I love taking leisurly drives
and getting lost. There isn't much like finding something cool looking that you make a mental note of because 
you can't (don't want to) nessecarily stop and investigate. But, by the time you get to your destination, it's 
super easy to have forgotten where it was. But this place peaked your interests, and now your best chance in 
finding the location is to cross your fingers and go at it again. Now, ordinarily this wouldn't be a problem.
However, if you don't re-find your destination on the subsequent attempts, you have boxed yourself into 
becoming familiar with this particular region. Now, your sacrificing opportunities to see and learn more about
your surroundings by getting lost just as you loved in the beginning. This project serves as a means for me to avoid
being lazy with the television, and share my work for any who may be interested in any part.


Minimum requirements of the project:
- one big button that tiggers a gps ping and stores the co-ordinates to a .txt file
* it's a simple project


Stretch Goals:
- attach led to provide "warmer/colder" indication for co-ordinates.
- Use led as a backup GPS for getting home if you really get lost
- provide initial .txt file with notable locations around the country(s) as a "show me something new" feature
